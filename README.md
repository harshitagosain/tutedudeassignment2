assignment 2 part1
This program-:
Takes an integer input from the user.
Uses the modulo operator % to determine if the number is divisible by 2.
If divisible (i.e., num % 2 == 0), it prints that the number is even.
Otherwise, it prints that the number is odd. 
concepts used-:
input() for user input
int() for type casting
% (modulo) to find remainders
Conditional logic with if and else
Output with print()
The result is as follows-:
Enter a number: 8
8 is an even number

Enter a number: 3
3 is an odd number


Initializes a variable total_sum to 0.
Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 49 (because range(1, 50) goes up to but does not include 50).
Adds each number to total_sum.
Prints the final result.
Save the code in a file named sum_1_to_51.py.
Open terminal, navigate and run:
The result is as follows -:
The sum of numbers from 1 to 49 is: 1225
